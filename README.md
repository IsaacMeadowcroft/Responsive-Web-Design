# My Personal Website
This is my (working progress) personal website. This website is responsive (can be opened on phone, table, computer). For now I am using this website to showcase my coding abilities and work experience. I made this website from scratch with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I had no web development experience prior to starting this project and learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript while making the website. Hope you enjoy :)

Check out how the website looks. It's hosted on GitHub here: https://isaacmeadowcroft.github.io/site/
